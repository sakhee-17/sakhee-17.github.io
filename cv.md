#### WORK

#### INTERN: Science Activity Center, Indian Institute for Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune
##### February 2020 - March 2021

Science Writing: I worked on the writing and editing of the description or explanation of the scientific concepts applied in each activity or its explanatory video developed by SAC in order to convey the science accurately as well as to generate curiosity and encourage further exploration about that concept.

Curriculum Development: I worked on a project funded by Tata Technologies to train local teachers in incorporating hands-on activities in their classrooms. As part of the core team, I participated in the development of activity-based lesson plans covering the different science and mathematics topics introduced and studied in grades 6-10
