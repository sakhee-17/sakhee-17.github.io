#### RESEARCH 
FLORIDA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY  
Department of Physics and Space Sciences   
##### Dr Cs. Palotai  
###### August 2017 - December 2017

I worked on simulations of the Great White Spot on Neptune using the EPIC model. I delivered a poster presentation, Studies of Dark Spots and Their Companion Clouds on the Ice Giant Planets, at the 49th Meeting of the Division of Planetary Sciences in October 2017.
##### Dr D. Ragozzine  
###### March 2015 - May 2017 

I developed a code for the normalization of planetary radii and orbital periods, in order to understand the architectures of exoplanet systems. I delivered an oral presentation, Investigating Normalized Architectures of Multi-Transiting Exoplanet Systems, at the 48th Meeting of the Division of Planetary Sciences in October 2016.
##### Dr C. Neish  
###### August 2014 - May 2015 

I processed images and observations of lunar impact crater properties using datasets obtained by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico and analyzed impact melt properties using Qview.

#### COMPUTATIONAL SKILLS
I have coding experience in Julia, Python, C++, and am familiar with the Unix environment.

#### INTERNSHIPS
##### Science Activity Center, Indian Institute for Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune
###### February 2020 - present
As part of the Tata Tech Project, I am assisting with writing lesson plans and reviewing lesson plan video scripts that are being created. I am writing concise explanations of concepts applied in the various science toys / activities that are developed or demonstrated at the Center as part of their educational and outreach efforts.

##### National Center for Radio Astrophysics (NCRA), India 
###### May 2016 - June 2016 
I was selected in the Visiting Student Research Program (VSRP) 2016. I analyzed Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) data of two Damped Lyman-alpha Absorbers: 1452+502 and J0934+3050, and measured their spin temperatures as part of a larger GMRT project to search for redshifted HI-21 cm absorption using the AIPS package for analysis.
