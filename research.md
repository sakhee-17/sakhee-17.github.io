[**Dr Rob Wittenmyer**](), [**Dr Duncan Wright**]()
July 2023 - present

I am working on a project funded by (grant) conducting photometric follow-up (SG1?) of TESS targets using the MINERVA-Australis(link) array. (from thesis proposal and 

#### [NASA Exoplanet Science Institute Caltech/IPAC]()
[**Dr. Jessie Christiansen**](https://www.ipac.caltech.edu/science/staff/jessie-christiansen)
October 2020 - present  
I statistically validated exoplanet candidates detected from K2 data by the EDI-Vetter pipeline [(Zink et al 2021)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....162..259Z/abstract) using the VESPA package [(Morton 2012)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...761....6M/abstract) as part of the Scaling K2 project. A [paper](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....163..244C/abstract) describing our work has been published in June 2022.

[**Dr Csaba Palotai**](https://www.fit.edu/faculty-profiles/p/palotai-csaba/)
August 2017 - December 2017

I worked on simulations of the Great White Spot on Neptune using the EPIC model. I delivered a poster presentation, Studies of Dark Spots and Their Companion Clouds on the Ice Giant Planets, at the 49th Meeting of the Division of Planetary Sciences in October 2017.

[**Dr Darin Ragozzine**](https://physics.byu.edu/department/directory/ragozzine)
March 2015 - May 2017  
I developed a code for the normalization of planetary radii and orbital periods, in order to understand the architectures of exoplanet systems. I delivered an oral presentation, Investigating Normalized Architectures of Multi-Transiting Exoplanet Systems, at the 48th Meeting of the Division of Planetary Sciences in October 2016.  

[**Dr Catherine Neish**](https://www.uwo.ca/earth/people/faculty/neish.html)
August 2014 - May 2015 

I processed images and observations of lunar impact crater properties using datasets obtained by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico and analyzed impact melt properties using Qview.

#### COMPUTATIONAL SKILLS
I have coding experience in Julia, Python, C++, and am familiar with the Unix environment.
