# Hello there! 

I am a PhD student at the University of Southern Queensland working on the precision photometric follow-up of high-value TESS targets using the Minerva-Australis array. I am also working with Dr. Jessie Christiansen on exoplanet demographics. I am passionate about and have experience working on science education, active learning in STEM, and science writing. Feel free to wander around the tabs above to learn more or contact me here: [sakhee.bhure@usq.edu.au](mailto:sakhee.bhure@unisq.edu.au)
