# Hello there! 

I am a PhD student at the University of Southern Queensland working on the precision photometric follow-up of high-value TESS targets using the Minerva-Australis array. I am also working with Dr. Jessie Christiansen on exoplanet demographics. I am passionate about and have experience working on science education, active learning in STEM, and science writing. Feel free to wander around the tabs above to learn more.
