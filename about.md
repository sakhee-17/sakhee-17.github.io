I graduated from Florida Institute of Technology with a Bachelor of Science degree in [Astronomy and Astrophysics](https://www.fit.edu/programs/astronomy-and-astrophysics-bs/). While in college I studied exoplanets, wrote [articles](\writing\) for Florida Tech's digital magazine, the [eCurrent](https://adastra.fit.edu/blog/author/sbhure2013/), plastered walls of residence halls with posters as part of my job as a [Resident](https://www.fit.edu/reslife/) [Assistant](https://www.instagram.com/floridatechreslife/), and of course, admired sunset skies and rocket launches.

After graduation, I have designed and conducted an [introductory astrophysics course](https://www.assettalentsearch.com/ats/images/programmes-by-asset-2019.pdf) for middle-school students, and have written a few articles for [The Wire](http://science.thewire.in/author/sbhure/).

Presently, I am working at the [Student Activity Center](http://www.iiserpune.ac.in/outreach/science-activity-centre/) at IISER Pune; I describe and explain the concepts applied in the activities and science toys being developed for use by educators and students throughout the country.

More details about all these projects can be found in my CV [here](\cv\).
