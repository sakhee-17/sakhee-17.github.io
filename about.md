I am a first-year PhD student at the University of Southern Queensland, working with [Dr. Rob WIttenmyer](https://astrophysics.unisq.edu.au/about-us/rob-wittenmyer/) and [Dr. Duncan Wright](https://astrophysics.unisq.edu.au/about-us/duncan-wright/) on the photometric follow-up of TESS observations of small planets around faint stars using the Minerva-Australis array. Since 2020, I have been working with [Dr. Jessie Christiansen](http://web.ipac.caltech.edu/staff/christia/index.html) on exoplanet demographics.

I graduated from Florida Institute of Technology with a Bachelor of Science degree in [Astronomy and Astrophysics](https://www.fit.edu/programs/astronomy-and-astrophysics-bs/){:target="_blank"}. During that time, I wrote [articles](\writing\) for Florida Tech's digital magazine, the [eCurrent](https://adastra.fit.edu/blog/author/sbhure2013/){:target="_blank"}, worked as a [peer leader](https://www.fit.edu/reslife/){:target="_blank"} [(Resident Assistant)](https://www.instagram.com/floridatechreslife/){:target="_blank"} and discovered exoplanet research.

I have worked on [curriculum design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccy1XVWfThU&list=PL6EJV4-csFcfqxcSSzIUWfnbxWDbAwf4w){:target="_blank"}, [science writing](http://science.thewire.in/author/sbhure/){:target="_blank"}, and [teacher training](http://https://www.iiserpune.ac.in/engage/outreach-and-training/science-activity-centre/){:target="_blank"}. 

Please feel free to [reach out](mailto:sakhee.bhure@unisq.edu.au) for more details about any of these or if you would like to collaborate on similar projects!
